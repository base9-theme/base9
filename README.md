# Base9

A system for generating themes for various apps using color science based on 9 colors that user prefers.

It is a spiritual successor of [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16), but offers better color theme and is more user friendly. For more info, see
[history and vision](./history_and_vision.md)

## How to use

First, pick 9 colors, either by selecting from exist presets, or randomly generate them, or hand pick them by following [Color Palette Guide](/guide/color_palette).

Copy the base9 **palette** code, which is the `-` separated hex value of the 9 colors.

Example: 

`282936-E9E9F4-FF5555-FFB86C-F1FA8C-50FA7B-8BE9FD-BD93F9-FF79C6`
